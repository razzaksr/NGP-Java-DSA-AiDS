Objective of programming:
	Data
	Operations/ functions:
		Create
		Read 
		Update
		Delete


Java Programming:
	Desktop
	Web
	Mobile
	
System Design Engineer
	Low level designer:
		design architecture, algorithms, design patterns, ...


Syntax:
class IDENTIFIER{
	public static void main(String[] identifier){
	.....
	}
}	


Java Development Kit >> Software DK
	build(.java) compile >> source code >> byte code(ASCII+UNI)>> .class
	Java Runtime Environment: in built classes grouped in packages
		Execute
		Java Virtual Machine:
			byte code to machine code
			
Compile: source to bytecode
	javac Filename.java
Execute:	bytecode to machine
	java Classname

Scanner >> java.util
	Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in); >> object
		nextInt	>> get int input from keyboard
		nextFloat
		nextDouble
		nextShort
		nextLong
		nextBoolean
		nextByte
	String:	
		next		>> word

Class has following members:
	data member>> objects/ variables 				
	member functions/ methods


Object Oriented Programming:
	Build the application with Security, Reusability

	Class
	Encapsulation:
		private data
		public function to access the private data

	Constructor:
		method/ function to be executed while creating an object
		it has priority execution over the other functions
		members initialization
		name of the constructor same as class name
	Polymorphism:
		Overloading: within class same block to be created multiple times by changing parameters type, order, count 
			constructor
			function
		Overriding: between two classes which involved in inheritance, which maintain same name, parameter

	Inheritance: Enables Object reusability between classes
		base/ super/ parent 
		derived / child 

		DerivedClass extends BaseClass

	Abstraction:
		interface like a class block:
			members>> data members, member functions

			class extends class
			class implements interface
			interface extends interface
			interface cannot inherit class


	





task:
employee
1. check which TAX slab
2. check eligibility of PL by check last 3/5 years ITR filed or not

Upcasting & down casting

Sealed and final

Object Cloning:
	1. implements Cloneable
	2. override clone in derived class


Wrapper classes: java.lang
int >> Integer
float>> Float
double>> Double
char>> Character
boolean>> Boolean
long>> Long
short>> Short
byte>> Byte

	Abstract Class PRODUCTS contains array consists product cost such as 900,4500,200,1600 
	methods:
	1. Non abstract method: findBoundary(min, max) >> Now finding existing costs which matches user given boundary like min and max inside same class
	2. Abstract method: findAll>> print all costs


	interface SHORTLIST contains
	1.Abstract method: findMax()>> Find max cost in that array, consider this method as abstract inside interface

	Inherit All in the class APP
